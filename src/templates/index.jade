    p.explanation
      | How You Been looks at your last several checkins on 
      a(href="http://foursquare.com/") foursquare
      | and tries to fish some meaningful keywords out of them.
      | It then searches 
      a(href="http://www.last.fm/") last.fm 
      | for those keywords, and builds a playlist for you based on 
      | the places you've been over the past little while.  
      
    p.explanation
      | You will also need to sign into last.fm in order to save a playlist 
      | which you can then stream.  In addition, being signed in lets How You Been 
      | tweak your playlist in order to favor artists you are more likely to enjoy.
      | You can still use the app without a last.fm account, but you'll need to 
      | find a way to stream the music on your own, and you're at the mercy of 
      | <code>Math.random()</code> for the songs you get.

      p.explanation
        | How You Been was written by <a href="http://timgilbert.wordpress.com/">Tim Gilbert</a>.
        | It is called &ldquo;How You Been&rdquo; because &ldquo;foursquast.fm&rdquo; was taken.
        | It does not store any data about you, because frankly your taste in music is terrible.
