# This is a deployment artifact, containing probably different values for 
# production vs dev instances.  The actual file consulted will be called 
# "config.ini".  In my local environment I've got a DEV and a PROD copy of
# this file; when deploying to appspot, I copy the PROD file to config.ini 
# and then run "appcfg.py update src" from the top level to deploy everything.
